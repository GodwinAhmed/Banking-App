Hi,

Due to the template issue arising from the template which we used in the tutorial and its configurations, I have created a boilerplate template.

If you don't know what a boilerplate code is, let's talk a little about it. A boilerplate template, often simply referred to as a boilerplate, is a standardized starting point for a particular type of project. It typically includes the basic structure, configuration, and often some initial code or files necessary to kickstart the development process.

This boilerplate template that I have created has only the static files configured for you. The main logic and functionality of the banking app have not been created for you; you will still need to do all that yourself by following the tutorial.

With this template:

1. You don't have to bother configuring the static files yourself.
2. Most of the main settings that you will need, which are complex to configure, like the static configurations in settings.py, have been added for you.

If you have any issues, shoot an email to desphixs@gmail.com.
