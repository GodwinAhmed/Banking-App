Hey there!

We have three folders here:

1. Django App Templates - This folder stores all the templates used in this course for different apps, such as userauths, core, account, etc.

2. Main Templates - These are the raw templates. I've attached them in case you need to tweak the templates your own way instead of using the ones I provided in the "App Templates" folder.

3. Assets - This is where all the images, CSS, JavaScript, and other materials for the course are stored.

!!! IMPORTANT !!!

We also have a boilerplate template:
1. Open the boilerplate template.
2. Read the "MUST-READ.md" file to get started using the boilerplate.
